                I wanted to do something kind of cool with this letter, physically, like maybe mirroring the letters so you'd have to read it in a
                mirror, but that sounds like too much work. this is the next best thing I could think of, hope it works.
                As I sit here in my room that will soon be not my room, I have two things on my mind. One, is the new destiny expansion
                coming out soon and the Rite of The Nine event that's happening at the same time and how i'm probably not going to be
                able to play it because I won't have access to my PC at the time. The other thing I'm thinking of is you, or more specifically 
                how confusing and wildly interesting you've been to my life as of late. Even after a 2 1/2 year long relationship, I don't think
                I had ever experienced someone who felt the way you do about me and it was scary at first. i did stupid things (as you know duh)
                and wish I hadn't because now we've switched roles.

                Now I'm the one being pulled along by a string, if that makes sense. Idk i 
                feel like you're leading me on a bit but it's like fine because I don't intend to cross any of your boundaries and i'm aware that
                i'm not what you need in life right now, in that way at least. I just want you to know that, of all of the relationships I've 
                made in my first year as an independent adult, you were the one who simultaneously gave me the most hope and the most personal
                struggle, and I think that's okay. It's okay that these fairly new experiences aren't going to turn out great. It's the same for 
                next year. It's gonna kind of suck but it's going to help us be better in the future and that's how far you have to think.

                I'm not a maker like you are, but I hope the time i spent making this letter shows that I care just as much to let you know
                how much I value you than each of your little trinkets have. So now that the boring mushy part of this letter is over, we can
                talk about something more normal and hopefully a little more uplifting. I still havent heard what you ARE looking forward to, only
                what you arent. So i think you should tell me if you have anything you are looking forward to, and we can focus on that stuff
                to try and forget about how awful this summer or next year might be.

                So yeah I guess that's my letter! I really hope this works because I just spent a bunch of time doing the code for this and i really hope
                I can make a Q (haha)R code for it. I also hope it's creative enough to rival your encrypted letter and all the trinkets you made me
                Anywya yeah if you're reading this i'm probably gone anywya so just text me!! toodles and kisses!
